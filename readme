# ECE 420 Lab 4
## Authors: Jared Cuglietta (1282916), Ryan Thornhill (1304096)

## Info
This is a MPI Implementation of Page Rank Algorithm

## How to build:
From the main directory run 'make' to generate the main executable in the root directory.

From the main directory run `make all`. This will create all executables in the bin directory.
You can also run make clean all. To perform a rebuild.

## How to run:
From the main directory run `./main <number of threads>` or 'bin/main <number of threads>' depending on which make target was run

## Other notes:
See readme in sdk directory on how to generate matrix input file, and test results.
